## Introduction

Welcome to a world where funding for innovative projects is fluid and controlled by a community of token holders, not just a select few. This is the value proposition of a decentralized grants program. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building such a program using the [ExecutorDAO](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/executor-dao) protocol on the Stacks blockchain.

Key features of this project include:

**Decentralized Governance**: Anyone holding a `membership-token` can vote on grant proposals.

**Open Proposal Submission**: Anyone can propose a grant, encouraging a wide range of ideas and projects.

**Smart Contract Automation**: All aspects of the grants program, from proposal submission to voting and fund distribution, are automated through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof processes.

In the following sections, we'll cover how to set up the core functionalities of our grants program- let's dive in!

## Understanding the ExecutorDAO Protocol

ExecutorDAO is a powerful and flexible protocol that allows for the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with a high degree of modularity and customization. ExecutorDAO operates on three core tenets:

**Proposals are smart contracts**:
Proposals in ExecutorDAO are expressed as smart contracts, allowing for precise, logical descriptions of the operations, duties, and members of the DAO. In our case, each grant application is a proposal expressed as a smart contract.

**The core executes, the extensions give form**:
ExecutorDAO starts with a single core contract whose sole purpose is to execute proposals and keep a list of authorized `extensions`. Extensions are contracts that can be enabled or disabled by proposals and add specific features to the DAO - like _proposing grants_, _voting on grants_, _distributing funds_, and more.

**Ownership control happens via sending context**:
ExecutorDAO follows a single-address ownership model. The core contract is the de facto owner of external ownable contracts. This allows any proposal or extension to act upon it, like the `membership-token` we will build out in the sections below.

For more details, you can [view the standard contracts in the ExecutorDAO repository](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/executor-dao/tree/main/contracts).

## Clone the Starter Template

In this section, we'll start by setting up your development environment. We've prepared a repository that includes an initialized Clarinet project and a React frontend with some boilerplate code and all the required library packages.

To clone the repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/hiro-hacks-template.git
cd hiro-hacks-template
```

## Create Your Core Contract

Before we begin, we're assuming that you have `clarinet` installed and a basic understanding of how to use it. If you haven't installed `clarinet` yet, you can do so by referring to our [installation guide](../clarinet/getting-started.md).

To create our core contract, navigate to your project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
clarinet contract new core
```

This will create a new contract in the `contracts` directory called `core.clar`.

> _**Note**_
>
> If you don't want to clone the provided starter template, you can create your `Clarinet` project manually by running `clarinet new grants-program && cd grants-program`.

Now let's walk through the key components of this contract.

### Traits

Traits in Clarity define a set of functions that a contract must implement. In this case, any contract that wants to be a proposal or an extension must implement the functions defined in the `proposal-trait` and `extension-trait` respectively.

You will need to add these contracts to your project:

```bash
clarinet contract new extension-trait && clarinet contract new proposal-trait
```

```clarity
;; extension-trait.clar
(define-trait extension-trait
  (
    (callback (principal (buff 34)) (response bool uint))
  )
)
```

```clarity
;; proposal-trait.clar
(define-trait proposal-trait
  (
    (execute (principal) (response bool uint))
  )
)

(define-read-only (executed-at (proposal <proposal-trait>))
  (map-get? executedProposals (contract-of proposal))
)
```

Inside our `core.clar` contract, we need to add our two trait contracts - `extension` and `proposal`:

```clarity
(use-trait proposal-trait .proposal-trait.proposal-trait)
(use-trait extension-trait .extension-trait.extension-trait)
```

### Constants and Variables

Next, the contract defines some constants and variables:

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (err u1000))
(define-constant ERR_ALREADY_EXECUTED (err u1001))
(define-constant ERR_INVALID_EXTENSION (err u1002))

(define-data-var executive principal tx-sender)
(define-map executedProposals principal uint)
(define-map extensions principal bool)
```

These constants represent error codes that the contract can return. The variables store the executive principal (the owner of the grants program), a map of executed proposals, and a map of authorized extensions.

### Authorization Check

The `is-self-or-extension` function is a private function that checks if the caller of a function is the contract itself or an authorized extension:

```clarity
(define-private (is-self-or-extension)
  (ok (asserts! (or (is-eq tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)) (is-extension contract-caller)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))
)

(define-read-only (is-extension (extension principal))
  (default-to false (map-get? extensions extension))
)
```

### Extension Management

Here we provide a function to enable or disable an extension (`set-extension`):

```clarity
(define-public (set-extension (extension principal) (enabled bool))
  (begin
    (try! (is-self-or-extension))
    (print {event: "extension", extension: extension, enabled: enabled})
    (ok (map-set extensions extension enabled))
  )
)
```

### Proposal Execution

The `execute` function allows for the execution of a proposal:

```clarity
(define-public (execute (proposal <proposal-trait>) (sender principal))
  (begin
    (try! (is-self-or-extension))
    (asserts! (map-insert executedProposals (contract-of proposal) block-height) ERR_ALREADY_EXECUTED)
    (print {event: "execute", proposal: proposal})
    (as-contract (contract-call? proposal execute sender))
  )
)
```

This function checks if the caller is authorized, inserts the proposal into the `executedProposals` map, and then calls the `execute` function of the proposal contract.

### Bootstrap

The `construct` function is used to bootstrap the grants program:

```clarity
(define-public (construct (proposal <proposal-trait>))
  (let
    (
      (sender tx-sender)
    )
    (asserts! (is-eq sender (var-get executive)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED)
    (var-set executive (as-contract tx-sender))
    (as-contract (execute proposal sender))
  )
)
```

This function checks if the caller is the executive, sets the executive to the contract itself, and then executes the provided proposal.

### Extension Requests

The request-extension-callback function allows an extension to request a callback:

```clarity
(define-public (request-extension-callback (extension <extension-trait>) (memo (buff 34)))
  (let
    (
      (sender tx-sender)
    )
    (asserts! (is-extension contract-caller) ERR_INVALID_EXTENSION)
    (asserts! (is-eq contract-caller (contract-of extension)) ERR_INVALID_EXTENSION)
    (as-contract (contract-call? extension callback sender memo))
  )
)
```

This function checks if the caller is an authorized extension and then calls the `callback` function of the extension contract.

These are the key components of the ExecutorDAO core contract. Understanding these will help you in building your own extensions and proposals.

## Create Your Membership Token

In this section, we will create our first `extension`, a non-transferable membership token, which will be used to grant voting rights on proposals. The token will be initially distributed to certain addresses during the bootstrapping process. However, new minting (distribution) and burning (removal) of tokens can be managed through proposals.

To create our membership token, navigate to your project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
clarinet contract new membership-token
```

This will create a new contract in the contracts directory called `membership-token.clar`.

Let's walk through the key components of this contract.

### Constants and Variables

The contract defines some constants and variables:

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (err u2000))
(define-constant ERR_NOT_TOKEN_OWNER (err u2001))
(define-constant ERR_MEMBERSHIP_LIMIT_REACHED (err u2002))

(define-fungible-token sGrant)

(define-data-var tokenName (string-ascii 32) "sGrant")
(define-data-var tokenSymbol (string-ascii 10) "SGT")
(define-data-var tokenUri (optional (string-utf8 256)) none)
(define-data-var tokenDecimals uint u6)
```

These constants represent error codes that the contract can return. The variables store the token name, symbol, URI, and decimals. The define-fungible-token function is used to define our sGrant token.

### Authorization Check

The `is-dao-or-extension`, function is a private function that checks if the caller of a function is the core contract itself or an authorized extension:

```clarity
(define-public (is-dao-or-extension)
  (ok (asserts! (or (is-eq tx-sender .core) (contract-call? .core is-extension contract-caller)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))
)
```

This function will allow you to distribute (or burn) tokens to new members, granting them the ability to vote on future grant proposals.

### Token Minting and Burning

The contract provides functions to `mint` (mint) and `burn` (burn) tokens:

```clarity
(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (begin
    (try! (is-dao-or-extension))
    (ft-mint? sGrant amount recipient)
  )
)

(define-public (burn (amount uint) (owner principal))
  (begin
    (try! (is-dao-or-extension))
    (ft-burn? sGrant amount owner)
  )
)
```

These functions check if the caller is authorized and then mint or burn the specified amount of sGrant tokens. And as you can see, these functions must be executed either through an approved grant proposal or an enabled `extension` (more on this later).

### Token Information

The contract provides functions to get the token's name (`get-name`), symbol (`get-symbol`), decimals (`get-decimals`), balance (`get-balance`), total supply (`get-total-supply`), and URI (`get-token-uri`):

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-name)
  (ok (var-get tokenName))
)

(define-read-only (get-symbol)
  (ok (var-get tokenSymbol))
)

(define-read-only (get-decimals)
  (ok (var-get tokenDecimals))
)

(define-read-only (get-balance (who principal))
  (ok (ft-get-balance sGrant who))
)

(define-read-only (get-total-supply)
  (ok (ft-get-supply sGrant))
)

(define-read-only (get-token-uri)
  (ok (var-get tokenUri))
)
```

These functions return the corresponding information about the `sGrant` token.

These are the key components of the `sGrant` token contract. Understanding these will help you in managing the distribution and burning of tokens through proposals.

## Proposal Submission Contract (Extension)

In this section, we will create our second `extension`, a proposal submission contract. This contract will allow anyone to propose a grant, which will then be voted on by the token holders.

To create our proposal submission contract, navigate to your project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
clarinet contract new proposal-submission
```

This will create a new contract in the contracts directory called proposal-submission.clar.

Let's walk through the key components of this contract.

### Traits and Constants

First, we need to implement the `extension-trait` and use the `proposal-trait`:

```clarity
(impl-trait .extension-trait.extension-trait)
(use-trait proposal-trait .proposal-trait.proposal-trait)
```

Next, we define some constants that represent error codes:

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (err u3000))
(define-constant ERR_UNKNOWN_PARAMETER (err u3001))
```

### Variables

We define a map to store the parameters of our contract:

```clarity
(define-map parameters (string-ascii 34) uint)
```

We set the proposal-duration parameter to a default value. This value represents the duration of a proposal in blocks. For example, if a block is mined approximately every 10 minutes, a proposal-duration of 1440 would be approximately 10 days.

```clarity
(map-set parameters "proposal-duration" u1440) ;; ~10 days based on a ~10 minute block time.
```

### Authorization Check

The is-dao-or-extension function is a private function that checks if the caller of a function is the core contract itself or an authorized extension:

```clarity
(define-public (is-dao-or-extension)
  (ok (asserts! (or (is-eq tx-sender .core) (contract-call? .core is-extension contract-caller)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))
)
```

### Parameters

The get-parameter function is a read-only function that returns the value of a parameter:

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-parameter (parameter (string-ascii 34)))
  (ok (unwrap! (map-get? parameters parameter) ERR_UNKNOWN_PARAMETER))
)
```

### Proposals

The propose function allows anyone to propose a grant:

```clarity
(define-public (propose (proposal <proposal-trait>) (title (string-ascii 50)) (description (string-utf8 500)))
  (begin
    (contract-call? .proposal-voting add-proposal
      proposal
      {
        end-block-height: (+ block-height (try! (get-parameter "proposal-duration"))),
        proposer: tx-sender,
        title: title,
        description: description
      }
    )
  )
)
```

This function calls the add-proposal function of the proposal-voting contract, passing the proposal contract, the current block height as the start block height, the current block height plus the proposal-duration as the end block height, the sender as the proposer, and the title and description of the proposal.

### Extension Callback

The callback function allows the core contract to request a callback:

```clarity
(define-public (callback (sender principal) (memo (buff 34)))
  (ok true)
)
```

These are the key components of the proposal submission contract. Understanding these will help you in managing the submission of proposals.

## Proposal Voting Contract (Extension)

n this section, we will create our third extension, a proposal voting contract. This contract will allow token holders to vote on the proposed grants.

To create our proposal voting contract, navigate to your project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
clarinet contract new proposal-voting
```

This will create a new contract in the contracts directory called proposal-voting.clar.

Let's walk through the key components of this contract.

### Traits and Constants

First, we need to implement the extension-trait and use the proposal-trait:

```clarity
(impl-trait .extension-trait.extension-trait)
(use-trait proposal-trait .proposal-trait.proposal-trait)
```

Next, we define some constants that represent error codes:

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (err u3000))
(define-constant ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_EXECUTED (err u3002))
(define-constant ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_EXISTS (err u3003))
(define-constant ERR_UNKNOWN_PROPOSAL (err u3004))
(define-constant ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_CONCLUDED (err u3005))
(define-constant ERR_PROPOSAL_INACTIVE (err u3006))
(define-constant ERR_PROPOSAL_NOT_CONCLUDED (err u3007))
(define-constant ERR_NO_VOTES_TO_RETURN (err u3008))
(define-constant ERR_END_BLOCK_HEIGHT_NOT_REACHED (err u3009))
(define-constant ERR_DISABLED (err u3010))
```

### Variables

We define a map to store the proposals and another map to store the total votes of each member:

```clarity
(define-map proposals
  principal
  {
    votes-for: uint,
    votes-against: uint,
    start-block-height: uint,
    end-block-height: uint,
    concluded: bool,
    passed: bool,
    proposer: principal,
    title: (string-ascii 50),
    description: (string-utf8 500)
  }
)

(define-map member-total-votes {proposal: principal, voter: principal} uint)
```

### Authorization Check

The is-dao-or-extension function is a private function that checks if the caller of a function is the core contract itself or an authorized extension:

```clarity
(define-public (is-dao-or-extension)
  (ok (asserts! (or (is-eq tx-sender .core) (contract-call? .core is-extension contract-caller)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))
)
```

### Proposals

The add-proposal function allows the core contract or an authorized extension to add a new proposal:

```clarity
(define-public (add-proposal (proposal <proposal-trait>) (data {start-block-height: uint, end-block-height: uint, proposer: principal, title: (string-ascii 50), description: (string-utf8 500)}))
  (begin
    (try! (is-dao-or-extension))
    (asserts! (is-none (contract-call? .executor-dao executed-at proposal)) ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_EXECUTED)
    (print {event: "propose", proposal: proposal, proposer: tx-sender})
    (ok (asserts! (map-insert proposals (contract-of proposal) (merge {votes-for: u0, votes-against: u0, concluded: false, passed: false} data)) ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_EXISTS))
  )
)
```

### Votes

The vote function allows a token holder to vote on a proposal. It checks if the voter has at least 1 membership-token:

```clarity
(define-public (vote (amount uint) (for bool) (proposal principal))
  (let
    (
      (proposal-data (unwrap! (map-get? proposals proposal) ERR_UNKNOWN_PROPOSAL))
    )
    (asserts! (>= (unwrap-panic (contract-call? .membership-token get-balance tx-sender)) u1) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED)
    (map-set member-total-votes {proposal: proposal, voter: tx-sender}
      (+ (get-current-total-votes proposal tx-sender) amount)
    )
    (map-set proposals proposal
      (if for
        (merge proposal-data {votes-for: (+ (get votes-for proposal-data) amount)})
        (merge proposal-data {votes-against: (+ (get votes-against proposal-data) amount)})
      )
    )
    (ok (print {event: "vote", proposal: proposal, voter: tx-sender, for: for, amount: amount}))
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-current-total-votes (proposal principal) (voter principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? member-total-votes {proposal: proposal, voter: voter}))
)
```


### Conclusion

The `conclude` function allows the core contract or an authorized extension to conclude a proposal:

```clarity
(define-public (conclude (proposal <proposal-trait>))
  (let
    (
      (proposal-data (unwrap! (map-get? proposals (contract-of proposal)) ERR_UNKNOWN_PROPOSAL))
      (passed (> (get votes-for proposal-data) (get votes-against proposal-data)))
    )
    (asserts! (not (get concluded proposal-data)) ERR_PROPOSAL_ALREADY_CONCLUDED)
    (asserts! (>= block-height (get end-block-height proposal-data)) ERR_END_BLOCK_HEIGHT_NOT_REACHED)
    (map-set proposals (contract-of proposal) (merge proposal-data {concluded: true, passed: passed}))
    (print {event: "conclude", proposal: proposal, passed: passed})
    (and passed (try! (contract-call? .executor-dao execute proposal tx-sender)))
    (ok passed)
  )
)
```

This function concludes a proposal. It first retrieves the proposal data and checks if the proposal has more votes for than against. It then asserts that the proposal has not already been concluded and that the current block height is greater than or equal to the end block height of the proposal. If these conditions are met, it sets the concluded and passed fields of the proposal data and prints an event. If the proposal passed, it also tries to execute the proposal. The function returns whether the proposal passed.

### Extension Callback

The callback function allows the core contract to request a callback:

```clarity
(define-public (callback (sender principal) (memo (buff 34)))
  (ok true)
)
```

## Initializing our Grants Program

Now that we have our core extension contracts, we can initialize our project. The way we do this is through the `construct` function we wrote inside our `core.clar` contract.

The way that we activate our grants program is to create our very first proposal contract. Let's go over the few things we want to do:

- Enable our extensions for our grants program (`membership-token`, `proposal-submission`, and `proposal-voting`).
- Distribute the initial token allocation to addresses who will be responsible for voting on grants.

Let's see what that looks like - run the following code to create a new contract:

```bash
clarinet contract new bootstrap
```

```clarity
(impl-trait .proposal-trait.proposal-trait)

(define-public (execute (sender principal))
  (begin
    ;; Enable extensions for the grants program
    (try! (contract-call? .core set-extension .membership-token true))
    (try! (contract-call? .core set-extension .proposal-submission true))
    (try! (contract-call? .core set-extension .proposal-voting true))

    ;; Distribute tokens to initial grants voters
    (try! (contract-call? .membership-token mint u100 tx-sender))
    (try! (contract-call? .membership-token mint u100 'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5))
    (try! (contract-call? .membership-token mint u100 'ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG))
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

This proposal will enable to contracts you have built, allowing the distribution of tokens, proposal submission, and grant voting to 3 addresses.

## Testing Locally

Now let's make sure our contracts are valid and don't have any errors. To do this, we can run the following command:

```bash
clarinet check
```

Next, let's try to bootstrap our decentralized grants program inside `clarinet console`:

```clarity
;; Check if `proposal-submission` extension is enabled
(contract-call? .core is-extension .proposal-submission) ;; false

;; Initialize your grants program
(contract-call? .core construct .bootstrap)

;; Re-check if `proposal-submission` extension is enabled 
(contract-call? .core is-extension .proposal-submission) ;; true
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created the foundations for a Decentralized Grants Program!
