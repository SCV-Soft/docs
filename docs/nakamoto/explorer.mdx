## What's New

### Introducing a Fresh View for Blocks

The Stacks Explorer now features a new way to display blocks, aligning with the Nakamoto upgrade's approach of multiple STX blocks settling into one BTC block.

### Tailored Viewing Experience

This new view is available on Testnet, accessible via the Network dropdown.

#### Two Distinctive Display Modes

1. **Independent Display:** Focuses on STX blocks progress.
2. **Grouped by Bitcoin Block:** Shows BTC blocks flow alongside STX blocks. (coming soon)
