The [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) is a cloud-based development environment that enables you to create, build and deploy Clarity smart contracts. The Hiro platform has pre-installed developer tools and helpful resources to improve developer productivity.

## Purpose

We want to encourage developers to focus on shipping their business models to Stacks blockchain, ship often and happily, and avoid getting caught up with unboxing and infrastructure overhead.

To deliver developer productivity, the Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the developer journey:

- VS Code in Web Browser
- Clarinet
- Clarity for VS Code
- Clarity Examples

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for translating your business models into code, testing them, and deploying them to a Stacks network!

:::note

While using the BETA release of the Hiro Platform, Hiro will **not** be liable for any data loss as described in the [Terms of Service](http://hiro.so/terms).

```js live noInline
import {makeRandomPrivKey,privateKeyToString,getAddressFromPrivateKey,TransactionVersion} from '@stacks/transactions';

import { StackingClient } from '@stacks/stacking';

import { StacksTestnet, StacksMainnet } from '@stacks/network';

import BN from 'bn.js';

// generate random key or use an existing key
const privateKey = privateKeyToString(makeRandomPrivKey());

// get Stacks address
// for mainnet, remove the TransactionVersion
const stxAddress = getAddressFromPrivateKey(privateKey, TransactionVersion.Testnet);

// instantiate the Stacker class for testnet
// for mainnet, use `new StacksMainnet()`
const client = new StackingClient(stxAddress, new StacksTestnet());
console.log(client);
