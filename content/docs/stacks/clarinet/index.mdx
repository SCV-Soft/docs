} from "@/components/ui/tooltip"

Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on mainnet.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>The smart contract language for Stacks</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code.

Clarinet can be used locally or as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](/stacks/platform).
