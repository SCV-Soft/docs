title: Overview
description: Clarinet is a local development environment that offers everything you need to create, test, and deploy smart contracts on Stacks.

import {
  Tooltip,
  TooltipContent,
  TooltipProvider,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from "../../../../components/ui/tooltip"

Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on mainnet.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>The smart contract language for Stacks</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code.

Clarinet can be used locally or as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](https://docs.hiro.so/platform).
