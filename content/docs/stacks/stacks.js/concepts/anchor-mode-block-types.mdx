title: Anchor Mode / Block Type
---

In the examples above, we used `AnchorMode.Any` to indicate that the transaction can be "mined" in different ways.
Stacks has two types of blocks: microblocks and (anchor) blocks.

- **Microblocks** (off-chain) are faster, but less reliable. Microblocks can be confirmed quickly but are not final until the microblock is included in an anchor block.
- **Anchor Blocks** (on-chain) are the normal Stacks blocks. They are slower, but more reliable. Anchor blocks are final and cannot be reverted.


<TypeTable
  type={{
    anchorMode: {
      description:
        'Permissions this app is requesting',
      type: 'offChainOnly" | "onChainOnly" | "any"',
      default: 'any',
    },
  }}
/>

```js
// AnchorMode options
anchorMode: "offChainOnly" | "onChainOnly" | "any",
```
