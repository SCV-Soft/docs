title: Post-Conditions
---

In Stacks, transactions can have *post-conditions*.

These are additional security to ensure the transaction was executed as expected.

More precisely, adding post-conditions to a transaction can ensure that:

- STX tokens were transferred from an address
- FTs/NFTs we transferred from an address

:::caution
Post-conditions aren't perfect. They can't say anything about the end-state after a transaction. So, they can't guarantee the receival of FTs/NFTs, since they only check for sending.
:::

An example adding a post-condition (of an address sending 1000 uSTX).

```js
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const tx = await makeContractCall({
  // ...
  postConditions: [
    Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6').willSendEq(1000).ustx(),
  ],
});
```

#### Post-Condition **Mode**

_...aka "allow transfer of unspecified assets?"_

In addition to the post-conditions itself, we can also specify a "mode" for the transaction to verify asset transfers.
The mode can be either `Allow` or `Deny`.

- `Allow` means that the transaction can transfer any asset (assuming no conflicting post-conditions).
- `Deny` means the transaction will fail if any asset transfers (not specified in the post-conditions) are attempted.

:::note
In either case, all post-conditions will still be checked.
By default, transactions are set to `Deny` mode for additional security.
