description: How does Fumadocs different from other existing frameworks
---

## Philosophy

The design of Fumadocs is a compound of backend
library (core) and frontend library (ui), it accepts different sources and gives you a good
looking, consistent UI.

Fumadocs, unlike the other frameworks, it expects you to write code and cooperate with other parts of your software.
While most frameworks are configured with a configuration file, they are usually lack of flexibility when you attempted to complete something more advanced.
You can't control how they render the page, neither the internal logic.

Fumadocs has no magic, it just give you the utilities and a good-looking user interface.
You are still using the features of Next.js App Router.
You are still configuring Static Site Generation same as a normal Next.js application.
Therefore, there are nothing new for Next.js developers, you are using it naturally.
You don't need any _hacky_ ways anymore, as they are now parts of your software.

For instance, in this docs, all index pages are rendered dynamically.
Feel free to take a look at the source code of this documentation.

## Nextra

Fumadocs is highly inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in Fumadocs.

**However, it is not a drop-in replacement for Nextra.**

While we both support a lot of
advanced usages, Nextra is more opinionated than Fumadocs. Fumadocs is accelerated by App Router. As a result, It provides many server-side functions and you have to
configure things manually compared to simply editing a configuration file.

Fumadocs works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features via plugins and custom themes.

### Better DX

Since Fumadocs is built on the top of Next.js, you'll have to start Next.js dev
server in order to review changes. And boilerbate code is relatively more
compared to Docusaurus. For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice
if you don't need any Next.js specific functionality.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things that will take you a few hours to setup
manually with plugins. Although the flexiblity of Fumadocs is high, their
eco-system is larger and maintained by many contributors.

### When to use Fumadocs?

For most of the web applications, vanilla React.js is no longer enough.
Nowadays, we also wish to have a blog, a showcase page, a FAQ page, etc. With a
fancy UI that's breathtaking, in these cases, Fumadocs can help you build the
docs easier, with less boilerbate.

## We are working forward

More and more advanced features will be rolling out. We currently support
multiple searching solutions including Algolia Search. A good UI and user
experience is always our priority, welcome to give us some advices via Github
discussions.
